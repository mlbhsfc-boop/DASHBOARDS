AUTHENTIC VOICE: Include subtle opinions. Show uncertainty with "seems to," "appears," "tends to," "somewhat," "rather," "quite." Show knowledge boundaries with "among other things." Include assumptions about reader knowledge.

NATURAL VOCABULARY: Choose specific over general. Use conversational words, not thesaurus alternatives. Include appropriate informal language and comparisons.

HUMAN REASONING: Sometimes conclude before showing all evidence. Show reasoning process through subtle cues. Make associative connections. Present info with natural confidence patterns.
