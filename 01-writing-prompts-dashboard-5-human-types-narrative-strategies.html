            <!-- FRAMEWORK DESCRIPTION -->
            <div class="framework-description">
                <p>The Five Human Types framework categorizes personality around core orientations rooted in fundamental fears and needs: Guardian (security), Seeker (truth), Sovereign (power), Builder (achievement), and Connector (relationship). Unlike trait-based models such as the Big Five, which measure personality dimensions along continuous scales, this system identifies discrete psychological types organized around existential concerns rather than behavioral tendencies. Where other frameworks describe how people differ, the Five Human Types examines why people organize their lives around particular core needs, exploring the underlying motivations, shadow patterns, and growth trajectories unique to each orientation.</p>
